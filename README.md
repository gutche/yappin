# Yappin ðŸ—£ ðŸ—£ ðŸ—£

Yappin is an modern messaging app built with the **Vue framework**. It uses the **Socket.IO** library for bidirectional and low-latency communication.

## Purpose

This app is being developed solely for educational purposes. I'm just trying out different frameworks and sockets (Vue and SocektIO) and figuring out how messaging apps work.

## Live demo

You can check out a working demo of the app [here](https://yappin.vercel.app/).

The backend of the app has stopped working as it had expended all its free tier resources available. I will rewrite the entire backend in Java or Go sometime in the future and deploy it

## Features

-   **Real-time messaging** with low latency
-   **Redis caching** for recent messages and event propagation

## Screenshot

Hereâ€™s a preview of how Yappin looks:

## Technologies Used

-   **Frontend**: Vue.js, Vite
-   **Backend**: Express, Socket.IO
-   **Database**: Redis, PostgreSQL
-   **Development**: Docker
-   **Media management service**: Cloudinary
